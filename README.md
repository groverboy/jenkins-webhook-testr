# jenkins-webhook-testr
Simple repo for experimenting with a webhook-triggered Jenkins job.

Change 1

Change 2 (after enabling TCP port for JNLP agents in CJE)

Change 3 (after installing Git on agent)

Change 4 (after trying webhook for game-of-life repo)

Change 5 (after exiting from SSH session: build failure due to failed attempt to lock file .git/config)

Change 6 (after restarting slave.jar on agent using "sudo -u jenkins java -jar ...", because of same build failure and may be appropriate for the process to run as "jenkins" instead of "gboy" (from SSH session))
